# Monte_Carlo_Simulation

This is a Python project that performs Monte Carlo simulations of the stock prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) using historical data. Monte Carlo simulation is a technique that uses random sampling to simulate complex systems or processes. In this case, the simulations are used to estimate the future stock prices of these two companies.
